This will execute a DocumentDB client FeedResponse method for you while handling retriable errors such as "too many requests". The caller must explicitly wrap the async call they want to make in a lambda. This is so that WithRetry can execute the lambda in order to ask for the task multiple times instead of getting an instance created at WithRetry method invocation time. Because of an implementation detail of the DocumentDb Client, you'll need your lambda to take the continuation token and apply it to the feed options passed into the method you've wrapped in your lambda. Example: "ExecuteResultWithRetry((continuation) => { feedOptions.RequestContinuation = continuation; YourCallHere(arguments, will, be, closured, feedOptions));"</td></tr><tr><td>![Public method](media/pubmethod.gif "Public method")![Static member](media/static.gif "Static member")</td><td><a href="b296ffe9-ff52-37a6-0466-9ef016cf207e">ExecuteFeedWithContinuationAndRetry(R)(Func(String, Task(FeedResponse(R))), EnumerationExceptionHandler, FeedResponseHandler, Nullable(Int32), Nullable(TimeSpan), ShouldRetry)</a></td><td>
