# ShouldRetry Delegate
 

If you wish to override the default retry logic, implement this prototype and pass it into the method call, or set DocumentDbExtensions.DefaultShouldRetryLogic You may wish to use this functionality, for example, if you have a sproc which is not "continuable" but instead throws a specific error that you can recognize as "entire transaction rolled back, please retry executing the entire call". In that case, your ShouldRetry logic can pick up on that and retry the call in its entirety. (Its recommended that your sprocs should instead return "how far they got" and be called a second time with those inputs removed in "continuation mode" course.) If your custom ShouldRetry logic can't understand the response, you should throw DocumentDbUnexpectedResponse. If your custom ShouldRetry logic can understand the response but it is not retriable, you should throw DocumentDbNonRetriableResponse or DocumentDbConflictResponse which is a special case of NonRetriable. If you throw any other exception type, that exception will be wrapped in DocumentDbRetryHandlerError.
